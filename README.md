This repository contains asingle script showing the basic steps necessary for integrating LiFE, probabilistic tractogrpahy based on MRtrix (v1.0) and AFQ.

The scrips shows how to:
(1) Preproess the raw diffusion data.

(2) Track using MRtrix.

(3) Run AFQ without building a full-AFQ structure.

(4) Clean the tracts identfied with AFQ.

(5) Build a LiFE model.

(6) Fit the LiFE model

Interfacing the LiFE workflow with NIMS 1.1
